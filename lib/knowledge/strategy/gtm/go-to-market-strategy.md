# Go-To-Market Strategy

## Introduction

Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy is the plan for how a company introduces and sells products to customers. A strong GTM strategy aligns product, marketing, sales, and customer success around a clear path to market penetration and revenue growth. This document provides a framework for designing and evaluating GTM strategies.

### Why GTM Strategy Matters

**Without GTM strategy:**
- Unfocused sales and marketing efforts
- Unclear target customer definition
- Misaligned messaging across channels
- Inefficient resource allocation
- Slow market penetration

**With GTM strategy:**
- Clear target market and ICP
- Aligned messaging and positioning
- Optimized channel selection
- Efficient resource deployment
- Measurable growth trajectory

## GTM Strategy Framework

### Core Components

Every GTM strategy must define:

1. **Target Market** - Who are you selling to?
2. **Value Proposition** - Why should they buy?
3. **Positioning** - How are you different?
4. **Pricing Model** - What does it cost?
5. **Sales Model** - How do you sell?
6. **Marketing Channels** - How do you reach them?
7. **Customer Success Model** - How do you retain them?
8. **Success Metrics** - How do you measure progress?

---

## 1. Target Market Definition

### Market Segmentation

**Segmentation Approaches:**

**By Company Characteristics (B2B):**
- Industry vertical (e.g., healthcare, fintech, manufacturing)
- Company size (employees, revenue)
- Geography (region, country, time zone)
- Technology stack (existing tools)
- Growth stage (startup, scale-up, enterprise)

**By User Characteristics (B2C):**
- Demographics (age, income, education)
- Psychographics (values, interests, lifestyle)
- Behaviors (purchase patterns, usage frequency)
- Geography (location, urban vs rural)

**By Use Case:**
- Problem being solved
- Job-to-be-done
- Workflow context
- Urgency level

### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

**B2B ICP Template:**
```
Firmographic:
- Industry: SaaS companies
- Company size: 50-500 employees
- Revenue: $5M-$50M ARR
- Geography: North America
- Tech stack: Uses Salesforce + HubSpot

Psychographic:
- Growth stage: Scaling rapidly (30%+ YoY)
- Pain point: Manual sales operations bottlenecks
- Buying behavior: Evaluate 3-5 vendors, 30-60 day sales cycle
- Budget authority: VP Sales or CRO

Behavioral:
- Active problem-seeking (inbound leads)
- Tech-forward (adopts new tools readily)
- Values efficiency over customization
```

**When to Use Multiple ICPs:**
- Different segments have distinct needs
- Separate sales motions required
- Distinct pricing or packaging
- Example: SMB self-serve + Enterprise sales-led

## 2. Value Proposition Design

### Components of Strong Value Proposition

**Formula:**
```
For [target customer]
Who [has this problem]
Our product [delivers this benefit]
Unlike [alternatives]
We [unique differentiator]
```

**Example:**
```
For fast-growing SaaS companies
Who struggle with manual, error-prone sales operations
Synth automates repetitive workflows using AI
Unlike traditional automation tools that require coding
We design workflows through natural language conversation
```

### Value Proposition Testing

**Key Questions:**
1. Is the problem urgent and important?
2. Is our solution meaningfully better than alternatives?
3. Is the ROI clear and quantifiable?
4. Can we prove value in a trial or demo?

**Validation Methods:**
- Customer interviews (10-20 ICP companies)
- Landing page conversion tests
- Sales call win/loss analysis
- Trial-to-paid conversion rates

---

## 3. Positioning Strategy

(See positioning.md for detailed framework)

**Key Positioning Decisions:**

**1. Category:**
- Create new category vs compete in existing
- Example: "Workflow automation" vs "AI operations platform"

**2. Comparison Set:**
- Who do customers compare you against?
- Manual processes, spreadsheets, competitors, DIY solutions

**3. Differentiation:**
- What makes you unique and defensible?
- Product capabilities, delivery model, pricing, support

**4. Proof Points:**
- Evidence that backs claims
- Customer stories, metrics, case studies

---

## 4. Pricing Model Selection

### Common B2B Pricing Models

**Usage-Based Pricing:**
- Charge per API call, workflow execution, data volume
- **Pros:** Aligns cost with value, grows with customer
- **Cons:** Unpredictable revenue, billing complexity
- **Best for:** Infrastructure tools, APIs, data services

**Seat-Based Pricing:**
- Charge per user per month
- **Pros:** Predictable revenue, simple to understand
- **Cons:** Limits adoption, misaligned with value
- **Best for:** Collaboration tools, team software

**Tiered Pricing:**
- Good/Better/Best packages with feature differentiation
- **Pros:** Captures different willingness-to-pay, upsell path
- **Cons:** Feature packaging complexity
- **Best for:** Most B2B SaaS products

**Freemium:**
- Free tier with paid upgrades
- **Pros:** Low barrier to adoption, viral growth
- **Cons:** Conversion challenges, support costs
- **Best for:** PLG motion, network effects products

**Enterprise Custom:**
- Negotiated pricing based on scope
- **Pros:** Captures maximum value from large customers
- **Cons:** Long sales cycles, resource intensive
- **Best for:** Complex deployments, large accounts

### Pricing Strategy Considerations

**Price Anchoring:**
- Set expectations with tier structure
- Example: $49/mo → $149/mo → $499/mo

**Packaging Strategy:**
- Feature gating (which features in which tier?)
- Usage limits (executions, users, integrations)
- Support levels (email vs phone vs dedicated CSM)

**Expansion Revenue:**
- How do customers grow spend over time?
- Seat expansion, usage growth, tier upgrades

## 5. Sales Model Selection

### Sales Motion Types

**Product-Led Growth (PLG):**
- Users sign up and adopt product without sales interaction
- **When to Use:** Low ACV (<$10k/year), simple product, self-serve setup
- **Sales Role:** Help high-value users, close expansion deals
- **Example:** Slack, Notion, Calendly

**Inside Sales:**
- Remote sales reps conduct demos and close deals via video/phone
- **When to Use:** Mid ACV ($10k-$100k), moderate complexity
- **Sales Cycle:** 30-90 days
- **Example:** HubSpot, Intercom, Gong

**Field Sales:**
- In-person meetings, complex evaluations, multi-stakeholder
- **When to Use:** High ACV (>$100k), complex deployments
- **Sales Cycle:** 90-180+ days
- **Example:** Salesforce, Workday, ServiceNow

**Channel/Partner Sales:**
- Sell through resellers, agencies, consultants
- **When to Use:** Requires implementation services, geographic reach
- **Economics:** Split revenue with partner
- **Example:** AWS (through system integrators)

**Hybrid Model:**
- Combine multiple motions for different segments
- Example: PLG for SMB + Inside sales for mid-market + Field for enterprise

### Sales Model Economics

**Key Metrics:**
- **ACV (Annual Contract Value):** Average deal size
- **Sales Cycle:** Days from first contact to close
- **Win Rate:** Deals won / Opportunities created
- **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):** Sales + Marketing cost per customer
- **CAC Payback Period:** Months to recover acquisition cost

**Example Economics:**
```
PLG Motion:
- ACV: $5,000
- Sales Cycle: 14 days (trial to paid)
- Win Rate: 15% (trial to paid conversion)
- CAC: $500 (marketing only)
- Payback: 1.2 months

Enterprise Motion:
- ACV: $150,000
- Sales Cycle: 120 days
- Win Rate: 25%
- CAC: $30,000 (AE + SE + Marketing)
- Payback: 2.4 months
```

## 6. Marketing Channel Strategy

### Channel Selection Framework

**Inbound Channels:**
- **Content Marketing:** Blog, SEO, guides, webinars
- **Paid Search:** Google Ads on intent keywords
- **Social Media:** LinkedIn, Twitter thought leadership
- **Community:** Forums, Slack groups, user communities
- **Product-Led:** Free tier, viral features, integrations

**Outbound Channels:**
- **Outbound Email:** Targeted prospecting sequences
- **LinkedIn Outreach:** Social selling, connection requests
- **Cold Calling:** Phone prospecting (decreasing effectiveness)
- **Direct Mail:** Physical mailings (high-touch accounts)
- **Events:** Conferences, trade shows, meetups

**Partner Channels:**
- **Referral Programs:** Customer referrals with incentives
- **Affiliate Programs:** Partners promote for commission
- **Integration Partnerships:** Co-marketing with complementary tools
- **Reseller Programs:** Partners sell your product

### Channel Prioritization

**Decision Criteria:**
1. **Where does ICP spend time?** (LinkedIn vs Reddit vs trade shows)
2. **What's working for competitors?** (analyze their presence)
3. **What can you execute well?** (content vs paid vs outbound)
4. **What's capital efficient?** (organic vs paid)
5. **What builds long-term assets?** (SEO/content vs paid ads)

**Recommended Approach:**
- Start with 1-2 channels, optimize to profitability
- Add channels sequentially, don't spread thin
- Expect 3-6 months to determine channel viability

## 7. Customer Success Model

### CS Model by Segment

**High-Touch (Enterprise):**
- Dedicated CSM assigned to each account
- Regular check-ins, QBRs, strategic planning
- **When:** ACV > $50k, complex products, expansion opportunity

**Low-Touch (Mid-Market):**
- CSM manages portfolio of 50-100 accounts
- Proactive outreach at milestones, reactive support
- **When:** ACV $10k-$50k, moderate complexity

**Tech-Touch (SMB):**
- Automated onboarding, email campaigns, self-serve resources
- No dedicated CSM, support via ticket system
- **When:** ACV < $10k, simple product, low margin

### CS Objectives

**Adoption:** Are customers using the product?
- Metrics: DAU/MAU, feature adoption, workflow completion

**Retention:** Are customers renewing?
- Metrics: Net retention rate, churn rate, renewal rate

**Expansion:** Are customers growing spend?
- Metrics: NRR (Net Revenue Retention), upsell rate, cross-sell rate

**Advocacy:** Are customers promoting you?
- Metrics: NPS, referrals, reviews, case studies

## Common GTM Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Boiling the Ocean

**Symptom:** Trying to serve everyone, no clear ICP
**Result:** Diluted messaging, inefficient sales, poor retention
**Fix:** Narrow to one ICP, dominate that segment, then expand

### Mistake 2: Sales/Marketing Misalignment

**Symptom:** Marketing generates leads sales won't call
**Result:** Wasted marketing spend, finger-pointing
**Fix:** Agree on ICP definition, lead qualification criteria, SLAs

### Mistake 3: Wrong Sales Motion for ACV

**Symptom:** Field sales team for $5k ACV product
**Result:** Unprofitable unit economics, slow growth
**Fix:** Match sales motion to ACV and complexity

### Mistake 4: Premature Scaling

**Symptom:** Hiring sales team before product-market fit
**Result:** Burn cash on unproductive reps, churn
**Fix:** Founder-led sales until repeatable, scalable playbook exists

### Mistake 5: Channel Sprawl

**Symptom:** Trying 10 marketing channels simultaneously
**Result:** Nothing works well, can't measure ROI
**Fix:** Focus on 1-2 channels, optimize to profitability

## INTERNAL CHECK

### Areas Where Evidence Is Weaker or Context-Dependent

- **CAC payback targets** - "<12 months" is a common benchmark but optimal value varies by capital efficiency, growth rate, and competitive dynamics
- **ACV thresholds for sales motions** - "$10k-$100k for inside sales" are approximate ranges; actual boundaries depend on product complexity and market maturity
- **Channel optimization timelines** - "3-6 months to determine viability" is a general guideline; some channels show results faster or slower
- **Retention benchmarks** - ">70% 3-month retention" is illustrative; acceptable retention varies significantly by product category and customer segment

### Confirmation: No Fabricated Sources

- GTM framework components are widely recognized in product marketing and sales strategy
- Sales motion categorizations (PLG, inside, field) are standard industry classifications
- Pricing models described are common B2B SaaS patterns
- No invented statistics or fabricated case studies
- Customer success models align with industry-standard segmentation approaches
