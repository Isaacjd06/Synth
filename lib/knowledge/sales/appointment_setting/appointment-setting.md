# Appointment Setting: Converting Interest into Sales Conversations

## Introduction

Appointment setting is the process of scheduling qualified sales conversations with prospects. It bridges the gap between initial interest and sales engagement—converting leads into booked meetings where substantive sales conversations can occur.

Effective appointment setting requires balancing persistence with respect, creating value in the outreach itself, and qualifying prospects efficiently. Poor appointment setting wastes everyone's time with unqualified meetings, while strong appointment setting fills the calendar with high-probability opportunities.

This document provides Synth with frameworks and best practices for designing appointment-setting workflows that generate qualified meetings systematically.

## The Appointment Setting Process

### Step 1: Prospecting and Research

Before reaching out, understand who you're contacting and why they might care.

**Firmographic Research:**
- Company size, industry, location
- Technology stack
- Growth indicators (hiring, funding, expansion)
- Recent news or changes

**Individual Research:**
- Role and responsibilities
- How long in current position
- Previous experience
- Social media activity and interests
- Mutual connections

**Trigger Event Identification:**
- Company expansion or contraction
- New funding rounds
- Leadership changes
- Product launches
- Regulatory changes affecting their industry
- Technology migrations

Research enables personalization that dramatically improves response rates.

### Step 2: Initial Outreach

First contact establishes whether the prospect is worth pursuing.

**Outreach Channels:**

**Email:**
- Scalable and measurable
- Allows for considered response
- Can include rich content (links, attachments)
- Lower intrusion than calling
- Typically 2-5% response rate for cold outreach

**Phone:**
- Immediate feedback
- Can handle objections in real-time
- Personal connection
- Higher impact per contact
- Lower contact rate (gatekeepers, voicemail)

**LinkedIn:**
- Professional context
- Easy research and personalization
- Less intrusive than cold calling
- Good for B2B
- Platform restrictions on volume

**Multi-Channel Sequences:**
Most effective approaches combine channels: email → LinkedIn → phone → email → phone over 7-14 days.

### Step 3: Value Proposition Delivery

Communicate why the prospect should invest time in a conversation.

**Effective Value Propositions:**
- Specific to their role/industry/situation
- Focus on outcomes, not features
- Reference relevant pain points
- Provide social proof (similar companies)
- Create curiosity without revealing everything

**Poor Value Propositions:**
- Generic ("We help companies succeed")
- Feature-focused ("Our platform has X, Y, Z")
- Self-serving ("We'd love to tell you about our product")
- Vague ("Let's discuss opportunities")

### Step 4: Handling Resistance

Most prospects will object, ignore, or defer. Persistence and skillful objection handling are critical.

**Common Objections:**
- "Not interested"
- "Send me information"
- "We're using [competitor]"
- "No budget"
- "No time"
- "Call me in [future timeframe]"

**Response Strategies:**
Each objection requires specific handling (detailed in objection-handling.md). The goal is understanding whether it's a true blocker or a reflexive response.

### Step 5: Scheduling the Meeting

Once interest is expressed, make scheduling frictionless.

**Best Practices:**
- Offer specific time options (not "when are you available?")
- Use scheduling tools (Calendly, Chili Piper) when appropriate
- Confirm immediately via email
- Send calendar invite with clear agenda
- Remind 24 hours before
- Include all relevant details (dial-in, attendees, duration, agenda)

### Step 6: Pre-Meeting Preparation

Set the meeting up for success.

**Send Pre-Meeting Information:**
- Agenda for the conversation
- Any materials to review
- Questions you'll explore
- Who will attend from your side

**Internal Preparation:**
- Review research and previous interactions
- Prepare relevant case studies or examples
- Identify likely questions and objections
- Confirm technical setup (video, screenshare)

## Appointment Setting Metrics

### Volume Metrics

**Outreach Volume:** Number of prospects contacted per day/week.

Typical ranges:
- SDRs (Sales Development Reps): 50-100 attempts per day
- Account Executives doing own prospecting: 20-30 per day

**Contact Rate:** Percentage of attempts that result in conversation.

Phone contact rates: 5-15% (varies by quality of data and persistence)
Email response rates: 2-5% cold, 10-20% warm

### Conversion Metrics

**Contact-to-Meeting Rate:** Percentage of conversations that result in scheduled meetings.

Typical ranges: 20-40% for qualified prospects

**Meeting Scheduled Rate:** Overall percentage of prospects contacted who book meetings.

Cold outbound: 1-3%
Inbound leads: 10-30%
Warm referrals: 30-60%

**Meeting Show Rate:** Percentage of scheduled meetings where prospect actually shows up.

Target: >80%
Below 70%: Problems with qualification or confirmation process

**Meeting-to-Opportunity Rate:** Percentage of meetings that become qualified opportunities.

Target: 40-60% (varies by qualification rigor)

### Efficiency Metrics

**Time to First Meeting:** Days from first contact to scheduled meeting.

Shorter is better but varies by sales cycle complexity.

**Meetings Per Rep Per Week:** Productivity indicator.

Typical targets: 8-15 meetings/week for SDRs

**Cost Per Meeting:** Total appointment setting costs divided by meetings scheduled.

Used to evaluate channel efficiency and resource allocation.

## Multi-Touch Sequences

Single touches rarely work. Systematic sequences improve response rates dramatically.

### Sequence Structure

**Touch Cadence:**
Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 12, 15 over three weeks is common, but test for your audience.

**Touch Sequence Example:**

**Day 1 - Email 1:** Introduction and value proposition
**Day 2 - LinkedIn:** Connection request with note
**Day 3 - Email 2:** Share relevant resource/insight
**Day 5 - Phone Call:** First call attempt
**Day 6 - Voicemail + Email:** Leave voicemail, send email referencing call
**Day 8 - LinkedIn:** Comment on their content or share relevant article
**Day 10 - Phone Call 2:** Second call attempt
**Day 12 - Email 3:** Case study or success story
**Day 15 - Final Email:** Breakup email ("I'll stop reaching out unless...")

**Breakup Email Power:**
Final emails often generate highest response rates. Prospects realize it's their last chance to engage.

### Personalization at Scale

**Template-Based with Custom Elements:**
Create templates for efficiency but customize key elements:
- Opening line (reference specific company/role detail)
- Value proposition (connect to their likely pain points)
- Call to action (specific to their situation)

**Trigger-Based Personalization:**
Reference recent events:
- "I saw your company just announced [news]"
- "Noticed you're hiring for [role]—suggests you're scaling [function]"
- "Saw your post about [topic]"

### A/B Testing Sequences

Test variables systematically:
- Subject lines
- Email length
- Value proposition framing
- Call-to-action timing
- Touch frequency
- Channel mix

Improve response rates 2-5x through systematic testing.

## Channel-Specific Best Practices

### Cold Email Best Practices

**Subject Lines:**
- Keep under 50 characters
- Avoid spam triggers ("Free," "Limited time," excessive punctuation)
- Create curiosity or reference specific relevance
- Test: personalization vs. curiosity vs. direct value

**Email Body:**
- Under 150 words ideal
- One clear call to action
- 2-3 short paragraphs maximum
- Personalized opening
- Specific value proposition
- Easy response mechanism

**Deliverability:**
- Warm up new domains gradually
- Keep sending volume reasonable (<100/day per domain)
- Monitor bounce and spam complaint rates
- Use proper authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)

### Cold Calling Best Practices

**Opening Statement:**
Don't ask "Is this a good time?" (answer is always no). Instead:
"Hi [Name], this is [You] from [Company]. I'm calling because [specific reason]. Is that something you'd be open to discussing?"

**Handling Gatekeepers:**
- Be respectful and professional
- Ask for help rather than demanding access
- Provide legitimate reason for calling
- Sometimes ask for other contacts if decision-maker unavailable

**Voicemail Strategy:**
Leave voicemails that create curiosity:
- Keep under 30 seconds
- State clear reason for calling (value, not features)
- Provide callback number clearly
- Mention follow-up email coming

### LinkedIn Outreach Best Practices

**Connection Requests:**
- Personalize note (not generic request)
- Reference shared interest or mutual connection
- Keep note under 300 characters
- Don't pitch in connection request

**InMail and Messages:**
- Similar to email best practices
- Slightly more conversational tone acceptable
- Reference profile elements
- Avoid obviously automated messages

## Common Appointment Setting Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Weak Qualification During Appointment Setting

Booking meetings with anyone who says yes wastes sales time and damages credibility.

**Solution:** Qualify during appointment setting:
- Confirm they match ICP criteria
- Ensure they have authority or influence
- Verify genuine interest vs. just being polite
- Ask preliminary qualification questions

### Mistake 2: Feature Dumping Instead of Value Communication

Listing features overwhelms and fails to create interest.

**Solution:** Lead with outcomes:
- What problem you solve
- Results you deliver
- Who you help
Save features for the actual meeting.

### Mistake 3: Giving Up Too Early

Most appointments come after 5-8 touches, but many reps stop after 2-3.

**Solution:** Commit to systematic sequences. Track response rates by touch number to optimize sequence length.

### Mistake 4: Poor Follow-Up After Initial Interest

Prospect expresses interest, but meeting never gets scheduled due to poor follow-up.

**Solution:**
- Strike while iron is hot—schedule immediately
- Use scheduling tools for friction-free booking
- Send confirmation instantly
- Add to calendar with reminders

### Mistake 5: No-Shows

Meetings scheduled but prospect doesn't attend.

**Solution:**
- Confirm 24 hours before
- Send reminder 1 hour before
- Make canceling easy (better than no-show)
- If they no-show, reschedule professionally once, then re-qualify

### Mistake 6: Generic, Automated-Sounding Outreach

Prospects can tell when messages are generic templates blasted to thousands.

**Solution:** Balance scale and personalization:
- Templates for structure and efficiency
- Personalize opening and key elements
- Reference specific, verifiable details
- Avoid obvious automation tells
