# Sales Qualification: Separating Real Opportunities from Time Wasters

## Introduction

Sales qualification is the systematic process of determining whether a prospect is likely to become a customer—whether they have the need, budget, authority, and timeline to make a purchase. Qualification saves time, increases close rates, and ensures sales resources focus on winnable opportunities.

Without rigorous qualification, sales pipelines fill with unqualified prospects that waste time, distort forecasts, and never convert. Strong qualification may reduce pipeline volume but dramatically improves pipeline quality and predictability.

This document provides Synth with established qualification frameworks (BANT, MEDDIC, CHAMP, GPCT) and best practices for implementing qualification systematically through workflows.

## Why Qualification Matters

**The Cost of Poor Qualification:**
- Wasted time on prospects who won't buy
- Inflated pipelines that mask real pipeline problems
- Inaccurate forecasts leading to bad decisions
- Demotivated sales teams chasing dead ends
- Lower close rates and longer sales cycles

**The Benefits of Strong Qualification:**
- Higher win rates (20-40% vs. 5-15% for unqualified)
- Shorter sales cycles (focus on buyers, not browsers)
- Accurate forecasting (pipeline represents real potential)
- Better resource allocation (invest time in winnable deals)
- Improved morale (wins feel achievable, not random)

Early, ruthless qualification is one of the highest-leverage activities in sales.

## Core Qualification Frameworks

### BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline)

BANT, developed by IBM, remains one of the most widely used qualification frameworks due to its simplicity and completeness.

**Budget:**
Does the prospect have money allocated or available for this purchase?

**Questions to ask:**
- "What budget have you allocated for solving this problem?"
- "What's your typical investment range for solutions like this?"
- "Where would funding come from—existing budget or new allocation?"
- "What's your approval process for investments of this size?"

**Red flags:**
- "We don't have budget" (may mean not priority, not truly no money)
- "We'll figure out budget if we find the right solution" (low commitment)
- Refusal to discuss budget at all (often means they can't afford it)

**Authority:**
Is the prospect empowered to make or strongly influence the purchase decision?

**Questions to ask:**
- "Walk me through your decision-making process for this type of purchase"
- "Who else needs to be involved in this decision?"
- "What's your role in making this decision?"
- "Who has final sign-off authority?"

**Red flags:**
- "I need to run this by my boss" (they're not the decision-maker)
- Large committees with unclear decision processes
- No access to economic buyer
- Contact can't articulate decision criteria or process

**Need:**
Does the prospect have a genuine business problem your solution solves?

**Questions to ask:**
- "What specific problem are you trying to solve?"
- "What's the impact of not solving this problem?"
- "What have you tried before? Why didn't it work?"
- "If you could wave a magic wand, what would the ideal solution look like?"

**Red flags:**
- Vague or generic problem descriptions
- Low pain or urgency ("nice to have, not must-have")
- Problem doesn't align with your solution's strengths
- No clear success metrics

**Timeline:**
Does the prospect have a specific timeframe for making a decision?

**Questions to ask:**
- "When do you need this solution in place?"
- "What's driving that timeline?"
- "What happens if you don't solve this by then?"
- "What could delay or accelerate this timeline?"

**Red flags:**
- "We're just looking" (no urgency)
- "Sometime next year" (vague, distant timeline)
- Timeline driven by arbitrary dates, not business need
- No consequences for missing timeline

**BANT Scoring:**
Some organizations require all four criteria; others use threshold systems (3 of 4, or weighted scoring). The key is consistency—define what constitutes "qualified" clearly.

**BANT Limitations:**
- Developed for traditional sales; may not fit modern buying processes
- Can be too rigid (eliminating prospects who might self-qualify later)
- Budget question can feel intrusive early in relationship
- Doesn't capture competitive situation or implementation complexity

### MEDDIC (Metrics, Economic Buyer, Decision Criteria, Decision Process, Identify Pain, Champion)

MEDDIC, developed by PTC for complex B2B sales, adds depth to qualification by focusing on the buying organization's internal dynamics.

**Metrics:**
What quantifiable impact will your solution have?

**Questions to ask:**
- "How will you measure success?"
- "What specific KPIs or metrics need to improve?"
- "What improvement would justify this investment?"
- "How do you currently track these metrics?"

**Value:** Metrics ground the sale in business outcomes rather than features, making ROI conversations concrete.

**Economic Buyer:**
Who controls the budget and has final purchase authority?

**Questions to ask:**
- "Who signs contracts of this size?"
- "Who owns the budget for this initiative?"
- "Can you introduce me to [Economic Buyer]?"

**Value:** Identifying and engaging the true decision-maker dramatically increases close probability. Deals without economic buyer access often stall or go nowhere.

**Decision Criteria:**
What formal and informal criteria will the prospect use to evaluate solutions?

**Questions to ask:**
- "What are your must-haves vs. nice-to-haves?"
- "How will you evaluate different vendors?"
- "What would make one solution better than another?"
- "Are there any deal-breakers?"

**Value:** Understanding decision criteria allows you to position your strengths against evaluation factors and identify gaps you need to address.

**Decision Process:**
What steps must occur between initial conversation and signed contract?

**Questions to ask:**
- "Walk me through your purchasing process"
- "Who needs to approve this?"
- "What happens after we submit a proposal?"
- "How long does each step typically take?"

**Value:** Mapping the decision process reveals potential delays, required approvals, and stakeholder involvement. It prevents surprises and allows proactive management.

**Identify Pain:**
What specific business pain is driving this purchase?

**Questions to ask:**
- "What prompted you to look for a solution now?"
- "What's the cost of not solving this problem?"
- "How is this problem affecting your business/team/goals?"
- "What have you tried? Why didn't it work?"

**Value:** Pain creates urgency. No pain = no urgency = no close. Quantifying pain makes ROI discussions compelling.

**Champion:**
Do you have an internal advocate who sells for you when you're not there?

**Questions to ask:**
- "Who internally believes this problem needs to be solved?"
- "Who would benefit most from this solution?"
- "Who can help me navigate your organization?"
- "Would you be willing to introduce me to other stakeholders?"

**Value:** Champions guide you through the organization, provide intel, advocate during internal discussions, and navigate politics. Deals without champions have much lower win rates.

**MEDDIC Scoring:**
Many organizations require all six elements to qualify. Others use graduated systems (4+ to qualify, 6 to forecast commit category).

**MEDDIC Strengths:**
- Comprehensive picture of buying dynamics
- Focus on business outcomes (Metrics, Pain)
- Emphasis on stakeholder engagement (Champion, Economic Buyer)
- Process orientation (Decision Process)

**MEDDIC Limitations:**
- Can feel like lengthy interrogation if not done conversationally
- Requires multiple conversations to gather all information
- May be overkill for smaller, simpler deals

### CHAMP (Challenges, Authority, Money, Prioritization)

CHAMP flips BANT by leading with challenges rather than budget, recognizing that modern buyers resist budget questions early.

**Challenges:**
What business challenges is the prospect facing?

**Questions to ask:**
- "What challenges are you trying to address?"
- "What's working well? What isn't?"
- "If you could change one thing about your current situation, what would it be?"

**Value:** Leading with challenges builds rapport and uncovers multiple potential pain points before narrowing focus.

**Authority:**
(Same as BANT—decision-making power and influence)

**Money:**
(Same as BANT Budget, but approached after understanding challenges)

**Prioritization:**
Is solving this problem a top priority, or just something they're exploring?

**Questions to ask:**
- "Where does this fall on your priority list?"
- "What else are you working on that competes for resources/attention?"
- "If you don't address this now, what happens?"
- "What would need to happen for this to become top priority?"

**Value:** Many prospects have budgets and authority but lack urgency. Prioritization reveals whether they'll actually move forward.

**CHAMP Strengths:**
- More conversational approach (challenges before budget)
- Prioritization explicitly addresses urgency
- Better for early-stage conversations

**CHAMP Limitations:**
- Similar to BANT with different order/emphasis
- Still requires uncomfortable questions
- May not capture enough complexity for large deals

### GPCT (Goals, Plans, Challenges, Timeline)

GPCT, used by HubSpot, focuses on the prospect's strategic context.

**Goals:**
What are the prospect's business goals?

**Plans:**
What plans do they have to achieve those goals?

**Challenges:**
What challenges stand in the way of their plans?

**Timeline:**
When do they need to achieve their goals?

**GPCT Strengths:**
- Strategic framing (goals/plans)
- Positions you as strategic partner, not vendor
- Natural conversation flow

**GPCT Limitations:**
- Less explicit about budget and authority
- May miss critical qualification factors
- Better for consultative selling than transactional

### AN (Authority, Need)

The simplest framework: just Authority and Need. Used for high-velocity, transactional sales where budget and timeline are less critical (small deal sizes, short cycles).

**When to use:**
- Small deal sizes (budget less critical)
- Short sales cycles (timeline naturally compressed)
- Clear value propositions (need is obvious)
- Simple buying processes

## Qualification in Practice

### Early-Stage Qualification (Lead Qualification)

Goal: Determine if the lead is worth sales follow-up.

**Minimum criteria (vary by business):**
- Matches ICP firmographics (size, industry, geography)
- Has indicated some interest (inbound) or fits targeting (outbound)
- Contactable (valid email/phone)
- Not obvious disqualifier (competitor, student, wrong market)

This lightweight qualification happens before significant sales investment.

### Discovery Qualification

Goal: Determine if opportunity should enter active pipeline.

**During first meaningful conversation:**
- Understand need/challenges
- Identify authority and stakeholders
- Gauge priority and urgency
- Explore budget or investment readiness
- Establish timeline or buying process

This deeper qualification determines whether to invest sales resources pursuing the opportunity.

### Ongoing Qualification

Qualification isn't one-time—it's continuous. As you learn more, reassess qualification:

**Reasons to disqualify during sales process:**
- Budget disappears or was never real
- Timeline pushes indefinitely
- Decision-maker changes, new person has different priorities
- Needs change and no longer align
- Internal champion leaves or loses influence
- Priorities shift (competing initiative wins resources)
- Technical fit issues emerge

Don't cling to false hope. Disqualify early and reallocate time to winnable opportunities.

### Disqualification as Strategy

Good salespeople aggressively disqualify. If a prospect can't or won't buy, learning that quickly is valuable. Time saved on unqualified prospects can be invested in qualified ones.

**How to disqualify gracefully:**
- "Based on what you've told me about [budget/timeline/priorities], I don't think this is the right time. Can I check back in [timeframe]?"
- "It sounds like [competing solution/approach] might be a better fit for your situation. Here's why..."
- "Given [constraint], I don't want to waste your time. Let's reconnect when [condition changes]."

Disqualifying professionally preserves relationships for future opportunities.

## Qualification Questions Library

### Budget/Money Questions

**Direct:**
- "What budget do you have allocated for this?"
- "What investment range are you comfortable with?"

**Indirect (less confrontational):**
- "How do you typically approach investments like this?"
- "What would need to be true about the value for this to be worth pursuing?"
- "If we can show [outcome], would that justify an investment of $X?"

### Authority Questions

**Direct:**
- "Are you the decision-maker for this purchase?"
- "Who else is involved in the decision?"

**Indirect:**
- "Walk me through how decisions like this get made at your company"
- "Who else should I be talking to?"
- "What's your role in moving this forward?"

### Need/Pain Questions

**Surface-level:**
- "What challenges are you facing?"
- "What prompted you to reach out?"

**Deeper:**
- "What's the cost of not solving this?"
- "How is this affecting your ability to hit goals?"
- "What have you tried before? Why didn't it work?"

### Timeline/Urgency Questions

**Direct:**
- "When do you need to have this in place?"
- "What's driving that timeline?"

**Uncovering real urgency:**
- "What happens if you don't solve this by then?"
- "What would cause you to move faster or slower?"
- "Is this timeline flexible or fixed?"

## Common Qualification Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Accepting Surface-Level Answers

Prospects may give polite, vague answers. Good qualification requires follow-up.

**Bad:**
Q: "Do you have budget?"
A: "Yes, we have budget."
*Accepts answer and moves on*

**Good:**
Q: "Do you have budget?"
A: "Yes, we have budget."
Q: "Great—what range are you working with?"
A: "We're thinking around $50K."
Q: "Is that already approved, or does it need approval?"

### Mistake 2: Qualifying Too Early or Too Late

Too early (first contact): Feels interrogative, breaks rapport
Too late (after proposal): Wasted effort on unqualified opportunity

**Optimal timing:** After establishing rapport and preliminary fit, but before investing significant effort in customization, demos, or proposals.

### Mistake 3: Failing to Document Qualification

If qualification insights live only in reps' heads, they can't inform forecasting, coaching, or analysis.

**Solution:** Require qualification fields in CRM, review during pipeline meetings, use for forecasting.

### Mistake 4: Qualification Theater

Going through qualification motions without truly evaluating fit. Marking fields as complete without honest assessment.

**Symptom:** Pipeline full of "qualified" opportunities that never close.

**Solution:** Tie qualification rigor to forecast accuracy. Review won and lost deals against qualification data to validate criteria.

### Mistake 5: One-Size-Fits-All Qualification

Different deal sizes, sales cycles, and buying processes require different qualification approaches.

**Solution:** Adapt framework to context:
- Small deals: Lighter qualification (AN or simplified BANT)
- Large deals: Comprehensive qualification (MEDDIC or MEDDIC + BANT)
- Strategic accounts: Relationship and political dynamics
- Transactional: Speed over depth

## Qualification and Workflow Design in Synth

Qualification can be partially automated:

**Lead Scoring for Initial Qualification:**
- Auto-score based on firmographics and behavior
- Flag high-scoring leads for immediate follow-up
- Route qualified leads to appropriate reps

**Qualification Question Workflows:**
- Prompt reps with qualification questions based on stage
- Require qualification field completion before stage advancement
- Flag incomplete qualification for manager review

**Disqualification Automation:**
- Auto-disqualify based on hard criteria (competitor, wrong geography, too small)
- Suggest disqualification when aging without progress
- Create re-engagement campaigns for future-qualified leads

**Qualification Tracking and Analysis:**
- Track qualification completion rates by rep
- Correlate qualification thoroughness with win rates
- Identify which qualification criteria best predict closes
- Alert to pipeline quality issues (many unqualified opportunities)

**Dynamic Qualification:**
- Adjust qualification questions based on lead source or segment
- Escalate high-value opportunities for additional qualification
- Streamline qualification for low-touch sales models

The principle: Synth should guide reps through systematic qualification, enforce qualification standards, and provide data on qualification quality and its relationship to sales outcomes.
