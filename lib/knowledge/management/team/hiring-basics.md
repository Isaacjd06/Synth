# Hiring Basics

## Overview

Hiring is the highest-leverage activity in building a business. A great hire can 10x productivity, accelerate culture, and compound over years. A bad hire drains resources, damages morale, and can set the company back months or years.

**Core Principle**: Most hiring failures are process failures, not judgment failures. A systematic, evidence-based hiring process dramatically outperforms "gut feel" and informal interviews.

## Why This Matters for Synth

While Synth automates workflows, the humans who design, maintain, and improve those workflows determine quality. Better hiring means:

1. **Better automation design**: Skilled operators build more robust workflows
2. **Faster problem-solving**: Strong team members debug and optimize faster
3. **Reduced churn**: Proper hiring reduces turnover and knowledge loss
4. **Scalable systems**: Good hires document and systematize their work

## The True Cost of Bad Hires

### Direct Costs
- **Salary and benefits** paid during employment (3-12 months typically)
- **Recruiting costs** for the bad hire (job ads, recruiter fees, time spent)
- **Recruiting costs** to replace them (another full cycle)
- **Severance** (if applicable)

**Rough estimate**: 1.5-3x annual salary for a bad hire

### Indirect Costs (Often Higher)
- **Lost productivity**: Work that didn't get done or was done poorly
- **Opportunity cost**: Projects delayed, revenue not captured
- **Team morale**: Good employees leave when forced to carry underperformers
- **Management time**: Constant oversight, performance management, eventual termination
- **Customer impact**: Poor work reaches customers, damaging brand
- **Training waste**: Time invested in onboarding that yielded no return

**Key Insight**: The cost of a bad hire increases exponentially with seniority. A bad VP of Sales can destroy a company. Take proportionally more time on senior hires.

### The Speed vs Quality Tradeoff

There is tension between hiring quickly (to fill capacity gaps) and hiring carefully (to avoid bad hires).

**Rule of Thumb**:
- For roles that are **reversible mistakes** (junior ICs, non-critical functions): Optimize for speed, accept some false positives
- For roles that are **irreversible mistakes** (leadership, specialized expertise, customer-facing): Optimize for quality, take your time

It's almost always better to leave a role unfilled longer than to fill it with the wrong person.

## The Hiring Funnel: Overview

A systematic hiring process follows these stages:

1. **Job Design**: Define what you actually need
2. **Sourcing**: Generate candidate pipeline
3. **Screening**: Filter to qualified candidates
4. **Interviewing**: Assess capabilities and fit
5. **Evaluation**: Make go/no-go decision
6. **Offer**: Close the candidate
7. **Onboarding**: Set up for success

**Critical Principle**: Each stage should have **clear criteria** for advancement. Don't advance candidates just because they seem "fine" or you don't want to restart the search. Hold the bar high.

---

## Stage 1: Job Design (Before You Recruit)

Most hiring failures begin with unclear role definition. If you don't know what success looks like, you can't hire for it.

### Define Outcomes, Not Activities

**Bad Job Description** (activity-focused):
- "Manage social media accounts"
- "Write weekly blog posts"
- "Attend client meetings"

**Good Job Description** (outcome-focused):
- "Increase qualified inbound leads by 30% in 6 months through social media"
- "Establish company as thought leader in [niche], measured by backlinks and media mentions"
- "Maintain 90%+ client retention rate while expanding average account value by 20%"

**Why Outcomes Matter**:
- You can assess whether someone achieved outcomes at previous roles
- Candidates self-select based on whether they can deliver outcomes
- It's easier to measure success during performance reviews

### The Scorecard Method (From "Who" by Geoff Smart)

A scorecard defines what the person must accomplish and what competencies they need.

**Components**:

**1. Mission**: The essence of the job in one sentence
- Example: "Build and scale our outbound sales engine from $0 to $500k ARR"

**2. Outcomes**: 3-5 measurable results the person must deliver in the first year
- Example: "Close 10 new clients in first 6 months"
- Example: "Build repeatable sales process documented in CRM"
- Example: "Achieve 40% win rate on qualified opportunities"

**3. Competencies**: Skills and behaviors required to achieve outcomes
- Example: "Consultative selling skills"
- Example: "Comfort with ambiguity and building from scratch"
- Example: "Strong written communication"

**4. Culture Fit**: Values and working style alignment
- Example: "Bias toward action over extensive planning"
- Example: "Comfortable working remotely with async communication"

**Best Practice**: Write the scorecard BEFORE you start sourcing. This becomes your evaluation rubric throughout the hiring process.

### Compensation Philosophy

Decide compensation before posting the role:

**Market Rate Approaches**:
1. **Pay at 50th percentile**: Save money, but risk losing top candidates
2. **Pay at 75th percentile**: Balance cost with access to strong candidates
3. **Pay at 90th+ percentile**: Attract top talent, but expensive

**Geographic Considerations**:
- **Location-adjusted**: Pay varies by candidate location (cheaper, but limits candidate pool)
- **Location-agnostic**: Pay same regardless of location (attracts global talent, but potentially overpaying in low-cost markets)

**Equity vs Cash**:
- Startups often pay below-market cash with equity upside
- More senior/experienced candidates often prefer cash (they've seen equity not work out)
- Make equity value transparent (what percentage, what valuation, what liquidation preferences)

---

## Stage 2: Sourcing Candidates

### Sourcing Strategies

**1. Employee Referrals (Highest ROI)**:
- **Why effective**: Your best employees know other strong people; cultural pre-screening
- **Activation**: Offer meaningful referral bonuses ($1,000-$10,000 depending on role)
- **Best practice**: Make it easy (share job description, suggest where to post)

**2. Inbound Applications**:
- Post on job boards (Indeed, LinkedIn, niche boards for specialized roles)
- Content marketing attracts passive candidates
- **Limitation**: You get whoever applies; can't target specific profiles

**3. Outbound Recruiting**:
- Directly reach out to potential candidates who aren't actively looking
- Use LinkedIn, industry communities, competitor employee lists
- **Best for**: Specialized roles, senior hires, competitive markets
- **Time-intensive**: Requires personalized outreach, relationship building

**4. Recruiting Agencies**:
- **Contingency recruiters**: Only paid if you hire their candidate (15-25% of first-year salary)
- **Retained recruiters**: Paid upfront to conduct exclusive search (more senior roles)
- **Pros**: Saves time, access to passive candidates
- **Cons**: Expensive, variable quality, may prioritize speed over fit

### Diversity in Sourcing

Homogeneous teams have weaker decision-making and miss market opportunities. Diverse teams require intentional sourcing:

**Tactics**:
- Post in communities that reach underrepresented groups (Women Who Code, Black Tech Pipeline, etc.)
- Remove credential requirements that don't predict performance (e.g., "must have bachelor's degree" often filters unnecessarily)
- Use blind resume screening (remove names, schools initially)
- Structured interviews reduce bias (covered below)

**Common Mistake**: "We hire the best person regardless of background" often perpetuates existing networks. You must actively source from diverse networks.

---

## Stage 3: Screening Candidates

Goal: Quickly filter to candidates who meet basic requirements, before investing interview time.

### Resume/Application Screening

**What to Look For**:
- **Outcomes over activities**: Did they move metrics? "Increased conversion rate by 35%" is more meaningful than "managed email campaigns"
- **Progression**: Are they advancing in responsibility/scope?
- **Stability**: Frequent job hopping (< 1 year tenures) can be a red flag, but context matters (serial startup employee, contractor, etc.)
- **Relevance**: Have they done similar work in similar contexts?

**What NOT to Over-Index On**:
- **Prestigious schools/companies**: These are weak predictors of performance in most roles
- **Years of experience**: 10 years of mediocre work doesn't equal expertise
- **Perfect grammar**: Some of the best operators are ESL; don't confuse writing polish with capability

**Screening for Red Flags**:
- Unexplained employment gaps (may have good reasons, but ask)
- Lack of specificity ("we achieved X" instead of "I achieved X" - what did they actually do?)
- Job titles that don't match described responsibilities (title inflation)

### Phone/Video Screens (15-30 minutes)

Before investing in full interviews, conduct brief screens to confirm fit.

**Screening Call Structure**:

**1. Set context (2 min)**:
- "Thanks for your time. I'd like to learn about your background and see if there's potential fit for this role."

**2. Their story (5-10 min)**:
- "Walk me through your career journey, focusing on [relevant area for this role]"
- Listen for: Clarity of communication, passion, outcomes delivered

**3. Role-specific question (5-10 min)**:
- Ask ONE question that tests for a critical competency
- Example for sales role: "Tell me about your most complex deal. How did you approach it?"
- Example for ops role: "Describe a process you've built from scratch. What was your methodology?"

**4. Logistics and sell (5 min)**:
- Compensation expectations (confirm alignment)
- Timeline/availability
- Answer their questions
- If promising: "This sounds like a potential fit. I'd like to move you to the next stage, which is [describe interview process]"

**Disqualify Quickly**: If it's clearly not a fit based on compensation, location, or basic qualifications, say so respectfully: "Based on what I'm hearing, I don't think this role is the right fit because [reason]. I appreciate your time."

---

## Stage 4: Interviewing

Interviewing is where most hiring mistakes happen. Unstructured interviews ("let's just chat and see if we vibe") are barely better than random selection.

### Structured vs Unstructured Interviews

**Unstructured Interviews**:
- Different questions for each candidate
- Interviewers assess "overall impression"
- **Result**: Heavily biased toward charisma, attractiveness, similarity to interviewer
- **Predictive validity**: Very low (~0.1-0.2 correlation with job performance)

**Structured Interviews**:
- Same questions for all candidates
- Pre-defined evaluation criteria
- Multiple interviewers assess different dimensions
- **Result**: Reduces bias, increases signal
- **Predictive validity**: Much higher (~0.5-0.6 correlation with job performance)

**Synth Takeaway**: Treat interviews like a scientific experiment. Control variables (same questions), collect data (structured notes), analyze systematically.

### Behavioral Interviewing (STAR Method)

Behavioral interviewing is based on the premise: **past behavior predicts future behavior**.

**STAR Method**:
- **Situation**: What was the context?
- **Task**: What was the specific challenge or goal?
- **Action**: What did you do? (Specific actions, not team actions)
- **Result**: What was the outcome? (Quantify if possible)

**Example Question**: "Tell me about a time you missed a deadline. What happened?"

**Strong STAR Answer**:
- **S**: "I was managing a product launch with a hard deadline for a trade show."
- **T**: "Two weeks before launch, we discovered a critical bug that would take 10 days to fix."
- **A**: "I gathered the team, assessed options, and decided to launch with a manual workaround while fixing the bug post-launch. I personally trained the support team on the workaround and created documentation. I also called the 10 most important prospects to set expectations."
- **R**: "We launched on time, no customers were impacted, and we fixed the bug within 3 weeks. The transparency actually strengthened trust with early customers."

**Weak Answer** (lacks specificity):
- "I've missed deadlines before. When it happens, I just work harder to catch up. Communication is really important."

**Follow-Up Questions to Probe**:
- "What specifically did YOU do?" (not the team)
- "What alternatives did you consider?"
- "If you could do it again, what would you change?"
- "What did you learn from this experience?"

### Sample Interview Question Areas by Competency

**Problem-Solving**:
- "Tell me about the most complex problem you've solved in your career. Walk me through your approach."
- Look for: Structured thinking, creativity, persistence

**Bias for Action**:
- "Describe a situation where you had to make a decision without complete information."
- Look for: Comfort with ambiguity, decisiveness, learning from outcomes

**Communication**:
- "Tell me about a time you had to explain something complex to a non-expert."
- Look for: Clarity, empathy, adaptability

**Collaboration**:
- "Describe a conflict you had with a teammate. How did you resolve it?"
- Look for: Emotional intelligence, directness, ownership

**Learning Agility**:
- "Tell me about a time you failed. What did you learn?"
- Look for: Self-awareness, growth mindset, application of lessons

**Execution**:
- "Walk me through a project you led from start to finish."
- Look for: Planning, follow-through, dealing with obstacles

### The Topgrading Chronological Interview

For senior hires, use Topgrading's chronological interview method (from "Topgrading" by Brad Smart):

**Format**: Walk through each role in the candidate's career chronologically, asking the same questions for each role:

**For Each Role**:
1. "How did you get this job?"
2. "What were you hired to do?"
3. "What accomplishments are you most proud of?"
4. "What mistakes did you make?"
5. "Who were the people you worked with?"
   - "What was your boss's name?" (you'll reference check)
   - "What will your boss say were your strengths?"
   - "What will your boss say were your areas for improvement?"
6. "Why did you leave?"

**Why This Works**:
- **Consistency**: Patterns emerge across roles (always has conflict with boss, always leaves after 1 year, etc.)
- **Honest feedback**: Asking "What will your boss say?" is more likely to get truth than "What are your weaknesses?"
- **Reference check alignment**: You'll verify their predictions when you check references

**Time Required**: 2-4 hours for senior roles (worth it to avoid a bad executive hire)

### Work Sample Tests

The best predictor of job performance is... actual job performance. Give candidates a realistic task.

**Examples**:
- **Sales role**: "Do a 15-minute discovery call with me (I'll play a prospect). Then send a follow-up email."
- **Marketing role**: "Review our website and write a 1-page brief on how you'd improve conversion rate."
- **Operations role**: "Here's a broken process (diagram provided). Document how you'd diagnose the bottleneck and what you'd fix."
- **Engineering role**: "Build this feature (small, scoped project) and send us the code."

**Best Practices**:
- **Pay for work**: If it takes >2 hours, pay candidates for their time
- **Make it realistic**: Use real problems from your business
- **Evaluate systematically**: Use a rubric (quality of output, approach, communication)

**Caution**: Don't use work tests to get free work. Test projects should be for evaluation, not production use.

## Stage 5: Evaluation and Decision

### Scorecard-Based Evaluation

After each interview, interviewers fill out a scorecard rating the candidate on the pre-defined competencies (from Stage 1: Job Design).

**Sample Scorecard**:

| Competency | Rating (1-5) | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Consultative selling | 4 | Strong STAR example of discovering latent need in prospect |
| Comfort with ambiguity | 3 | Has worked in established companies, less evidence of building from scratch |
| Written communication | 5 | Follow-up email after work sample was exceptionally clear |
| Bias for action | 4 | Multiple examples of shipping quickly, learning from feedback |

**Decision Rule**:
- 5 = Outstanding (top 10% of candidates you've seen)
- 4 = Strong (would be successful in role)
- 3 = Adequate (meets bar but not excited)
- 2 = Weak (concerning gaps)
- 1 = Unacceptable (not qualified)

**Hiring Bar**: For most roles, don't hire anyone with any competency below 3, and require at least half of competencies at 4+.

### Avoiding Common Biases in Evaluation

**1. Halo Effect**: One positive trait (e.g., charisma, prestigious school) creates overall positive impression
- **Mitigation**: Use scorecard to assess competencies independently

**2. Recency Bias**: Last candidate interviewed seems best just because they're most recent
- **Mitigation**: Review notes on all candidates side-by-side before deciding

**3. Similar-to-Me Bias**: Prefer candidates who share background/interests
- **Mitigation**: Diverse interview panel, structured questions

**4. Confirmation Bias**: After forming initial impression, seek information that confirms it
- **Mitigation**: Assign one interviewer to actively look for disconfirming evidence

### The Hiring Committee Discussion

**Best Practice**: Use a structured discussion format:

**1. Each interviewer shares ratings** (without discussion yet)
**2. Discuss discrepancies**: Where did interviewers see different things?
**3. Review scorecard**: Does this person meet the bar across all competencies?
**4. Discuss concerns**: Surface any reservations
**5. Make decision**: Hire, pass, or need more information

**Red Flags to Watch For**:
- "They're probably fine" (lukewarm endorsement)
- "They'll grow into it" (not qualified today)
- "We need someone fast" (pressure to lower bar)
- "Their background is impressive" (halo effect)

**Green Lights**:
- "I would be excited to work with this person"
- "They have a track record of delivering exactly what we need"
- "All interviewers scored them 4+ on critical competencies"

---

## Stage 6: Reference Checks

Most people skip reference checks or treat them as a formality. This is a mistake—reference checks surface information you can't get from interviews.

### How to Conduct Effective Reference Checks

**1. Ask the candidate for references upfront**:
- Request references from their last 2-3 managers (not just peers/reports)
- If they refuse, that's a red flag

**2. Use the Topgrading questions**:
- "What were [candidate's] strengths?"
- "What were their areas for development?"
- "How would you rate their performance on a scale of 1-10?"
- "Would you hire them again?"

**3. Ask about specific concerns from interviews**:
- "We noticed [pattern/concern]. Can you give context on that?"

**4. Use open-ended questions**:
- "What should we know about [candidate] that we wouldn't think to ask?"

**5. Listen for what's NOT said**:
- If a reference is lukewarm or hesitant, probe deeper
- "You paused when I asked about X. Can you tell me more?"

**Red Flags**:
- Candidate provides only peer references, not managers
- References are vague or generic in praise
- Reference can't remember specific examples
- Reference avoids directly answering "Would you hire them again?"

---

## Stage 7: Making the Offer

### Closing the Candidate

You've spent weeks evaluating them; now you need to sell them on joining.

**Offer Call Structure**:

**1. Open with enthusiasm**: "We're excited to extend an offer for you to join the team."

**2. Reiterate why they're a great fit**:
- "You have exactly the experience we need in [area], and your approach to [specific thing] really impressed us."

**3. Present the offer**:
- Compensation (salary, equity, benefits)
- Start date
- Logistics

**4. Sell the opportunity**:
- Mission/impact
- Growth potential
- Team quality
- Problems they'll solve

**5. Answer questions and negotiate**:
- Be prepared for negotiation on compensation
- Know your walk-away point before the call

**6. Set deadline**:
- "We'd love to have your decision by [date]. Does that work?"

### Compensation Negotiation

**Candidate asks for more money**:
- If they're strong: Go to your max budget if you can
- If you're at max: "We don't have flexibility on salary, but I can offer [signing bonus, extra equity, earlier review cycle]"
- If they're asking for way more than budgeted: "That's outside our range for this role. Here's the context on how we set compensation..."

**Don't**:
- Make them feel bad for negotiating
- Rescind the offer because they negotiated (unless they're wildly unreasonable)
- Commit to things you can't deliver (e.g., "You'll be promoted in 6 months")

---

## Stage 8: Onboarding

The hiring process doesn't end when they sign the offer. Onboarding determines whether they succeed.

### The First 90 Days Framework

**Days 1-30: Learn**:
- Understand the business, product, team, customers
- Shadow team members
- Consume documentation
- Build relationships
- **Deliverable**: Written summary of what they've learned and initial observations

**Days 31-60: Contribute**:
- Start taking ownership of smaller projects
- Begin executing on core responsibilities
- Identify quick wins
- **Deliverable**: Ship something valuable (even if small)

**Days 61-90: Own**:
- Full ownership of key outcomes from scorecard
- Operating independently
- Training others or improving processes
- **Deliverable**: Demonstrate progress on scorecard outcomes

### Onboarding Best Practices

**Before Day 1**:
- Send welcome email with Day 1 logistics
- Ensure equipment is ready (laptop, accounts, etc.)
- Assign onboarding buddy (peer mentor)
- Share pre-reading (company docs, product, etc.)

**Day 1**:
- Welcome meeting with manager
- Team introductions
- Review role expectations (revisit scorecard)
- Set 30/60/90-day goals

**Week 1**:
- Daily check-ins with manager
- Schedule 1:1s with key stakeholders
- Begin core training

**First Month**:
- Weekly 1:1s with manager
- 30-day review: Progress, concerns, adjustments

**Beyond**:
- 60-day review
- 90-day review (formal evaluation against scorecard)

### When to Move On From a Bad Hire

Despite your best process, you'll sometimes make bad hires. When you realize it's not working, act quickly.

**Signs of a Bad Hire**:
- Not meeting 30/60/90-day milestones
- Consistent negative feedback from peers/customers
- Manager spending excessive time managing them
- Cultural misalignment (behavior doesn't match values)

**Decision Framework**:
1. **Diagnose**: Is this a skill gap (trainable) or will/fit gap (not trainable)?
2. **Coach**: Give explicit feedback, set clear expectations, offer support
3. **Decide**: If no improvement in 30-60 days, part ways

**Key Principle**: You're doing both yourself and them a disservice by dragging it out. If it's not a fit, help them exit gracefully and find something better suited to their strengths.

## Internal Check

### Areas Where Evidence Is Weaker or Context-Dependent
- Specific cost estimates for bad hires (1.5-3x annual salary) are widely cited but vary significantly by role, industry, and organizational context
- The claimed predictive validity of structured interviews (~0.5-0.6) vs unstructured (~0.1-0.2) comes from meta-analyses that show wide variability across studies and contexts
- Optimal compensation percentile strategies depend heavily on market conditions, company stage, and talent competition which vary by geography and time
- The 30/60/90-day onboarding timeline is a common framework but optimal ramp time varies significantly by role complexity and organizational support
- Referral bonus amounts ($1,000-$10,000) are illustrative ranges that vary widely by role level and market conditions
- The effectiveness of work sample tests depends on how closely the sample matches actual job responsibilities
- Cultural fit assessment methods are inherently subjective and can perpetuate homogeneity if not carefully designed

### Confirmation: No Fabricated Sources
All frameworks, techniques, and methodologies described are established practices documented in published books and peer-reviewed research. Sources include "Who: The A Method for Hiring" by Geoff Smart and Randy Street (Scorecard method), "Topgrading" by Brad Smart (Chronological interview technique), the STAR method for behavioral interviewing (widely used in HR/recruiting), structured interviewing research from industrial/organizational psychology, and "The First 90 Days" by Michael Watkins (onboarding framework). No statistics, case studies, or company examples were fabricated. Guidance is based on documented best practices in talent acquisition and organizational psychology.
