# Paid Ads Basics

## Overview

Paid advertising allows you to buy attention from your target audience. Unlike organic marketing (which takes months to compound), paid ads can drive traffic and leads immediately. The trade-off: you pay for every click or impression, and the moment you stop spending, the traffic stops.

**Core Principle**: Paid ads are a machine—you put money in one end, and if the machine is tuned correctly, you get more money out the other end. Success requires disciplined testing, measurement, and optimization.

## Why This Matters for Synth

Paid ads are particularly useful for automation businesses in specific scenarios:

1. **Fast validation**: Test messaging and positioning quickly before investing in content
2. **Scalable lead generation**: Once unit economics work, scale spend to scale revenue
3. **Targeting precision**: Reach specific roles, companies, or demographics
4. **Retargeting**: Stay top-of-mind with prospects who visited but didn't convert

## Paid Ads vs Organic Marketing

### When Paid Ads Make Sense

**Use paid ads when**:
- You need leads fast (launching, fundraising, hitting revenue targets)
- You have proven unit economics (CAC < LTV/3, ideally better)
- You want to test messaging before building content engine
- Your target audience is narrow and targetable (job titles, company sizes)
- You have budget to invest upfront

### When to Avoid Paid Ads

**Don't use paid ads when**:
- Unit economics don't work yet (you'll just burn money faster)
- You can't afford to test and lose money learning ($2-5k minimum monthly budget recommended)
- Your target audience is broad and unspecific (waste on irrelevant clicks)
- You have no one to manage campaigns (set-and-forget doesn't work)

**Best Practice**: Use paid ads + organic together. Paid ads drive short-term leads while you build long-term organic assets.

## Major Paid Advertising Platforms

### Google Ads (Search)

**What it is**: Text ads that appear when people search Google for specific keywords

**Best for**:
- High-intent buyers (people actively searching for solutions)
- B2B and B2C
- Service businesses

**Pros**:
- Highest intent traffic (they're searching for what you offer)
- Measurable ROI
- Scalable

**Cons**:
- Expensive for competitive keywords (CPC: $5-$50+ for B2B keywords)
- Requires ongoing optimization
- Learning curve for campaign management

**Example Use Case**: Someone searches "workflow automation consultant" → sees your ad → clicks → lands on your page

### LinkedIn Ads

**What it is**: Ads on LinkedIn targeting by job title, company, industry, seniority

**Best for**:
- B2B (especially targeting specific roles)
- High-ticket offers ($5k+ deal sizes)
- Decision-makers and executives

**Pros**:
- Extremely precise targeting (CTO at 100-500 employee SaaS companies)
- Professional context (people are in "work mode")
- Best for B2B

**Cons**:
- Most expensive platform (CPM: $30-$80, CPC: $8-$12)
- Requires larger budgets ($3-5k/month minimum to see results)
- Lower volume than Google or Facebook

### Twitter/X Ads

**What it is**: Promoted tweets in Twitter feeds

**Best for**:
- Tech-savvy audiences
- Thought leadership
- Event promotion

**Pros**:
- Reaches tech/startup audience

## Paid Search Fundamentals (Google Ads)

### Campaign Structure

**Account → Campaigns → Ad Groups → Ads + Keywords**

**Campaign Level**:
- Set overall budget
- Choose campaign type (Search, Display, Video)
- Set geographic targeting
- Example: "Workflow Automation - Search"

**Ad Group Level**:
- Group of related keywords
- Shared ads for that theme
- Example Ad Group: "Client Onboarding Automation"
  - Keywords: "automate client onboarding", "client onboarding software", "onboarding workflow automation"

**Ad Level**:
- The actual ad copy people see
- Headline, description, display URL
- Multiple ads per ad group (for testing)

### Keyword Match Types

How broadly or narrowly your ads match to searches:

**1. Broad Match**: "automation software"
- Matches: automation software, workflow tools, process automation, automate tasks
- **Pros**: Maximum reach
- **Cons**: Many irrelevant clicks, expensive

**2. Phrase Match**: "automation software"
- Matches: best automation software, automation software for agencies
- **Pros**: Balance of reach and relevance
- **Cons**: Still some irrelevant traffic

**3. Exact Match**: [automation software]
- Matches: automation software (and close variants like "automation softwares")
- **Pros**: Highest relevance
- **Cons**: Lower volume

**4. Negative Keywords**: -free, -DIY, -cheap
- Prevents ads from showing for searches with these words
- **Critical for controlling cost**: Add "free", "cheap", "DIY" as negatives if you sell premium

**Best Practice**: Start with phrase and exact match to control costs. Add negatives aggressively.

### Quality Score (Google Ads Metric)

Quality Score (1-10) affects your ad costs and position. Higher score = lower costs, better placement.

**Components**:
1. **Expected CTR** (Click-Through Rate): How likely people are to click your ad
2. **Ad Relevance**: How well your ad matches search intent
3. **Landing Page Experience**: How relevant and useful your landing page is

**How to Improve Quality Score**:
- Write ads that directly address search intent
- Include keyword in ad headline and description
- Send users to relevant landing pages (not homepage)
- Improve landing page speed and relevance

**Impact**: Improving Quality Score from 5 to 8 can reduce CPC by 30-50%.

### Ad Copy Best Practices

**Headline 1** (30 characters):
- Include primary keyword
- Example: "Automate Client Onboarding"

**Headline 2** (30 characters):
- State benefit or differentiation
- Example: "Save 10 Hours Per Week"

**Headline 3** (30 characters):
- Call to action or urgency
- Example: "Get Demo - Free Consultation"

**Description Lines** (90 characters each):
- Expand on value proposition
- Address objections
- Include call to action
- Example: "Streamline workflows with no-code automation. Trusted by 500+ agencies. Book your free workflow audit today."

**Display URL Path**:
- Include keyword for relevance
- Example: synthagency.com/client-onboarding

### Bidding Strategies

**Manual CPC (Cost Per Click)**:
- You set maximum bid per click
- **Best for**: When starting, learning what keywords work
- **Control**: High

**Enhanced CPC**:
- Google adjusts your bids to maximize conversions
- **Best for**: When you have some conversion data
- **Control**: Medium

**Maximize Conversions**:
- Google automatically sets bids to get most conversions within budget
- **Best for**: When you have 30+ conversions/month and trust Google
- **Control**: Low

**Target CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)**:
- Tell Google your target cost per conversion, it optimizes to hit that
- **Best for**: Mature campaigns with consistent conversion data
- **Control**: Medium

**Target ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**:
- Optimize for revenue, not just conversions
- **Best for**: E-commerce or when you track revenue per conversion
- **Control**: Medium

**Recommendation**: Start with Manual CPC to learn, move to automated bidding once you have 50+ conversions.

## Paid Social Fundamentals (LinkedIn, Facebook)

### Campaign Structure (LinkedIn & Facebook)

**Account → Campaigns → Ad Sets → Ads**

**Campaign Level**:
- Set objective (awareness, consideration, conversion)
- Set overall budget

**Ad Set Level** (Facebook) / Campaign Level (LinkedIn):
- Define audience targeting
- Set placement (feed, stories, etc.)
- Set schedule and budget

**Ad Level**:
- The creative (image/video + copy)
- Multiple ads per ad set for testing

### Targeting Options

**Demographic Targeting**:
- Age, gender, location, language
- **Facebook**: Very granular
- **LinkedIn**: Professional demographics (job title, seniority, company size, industry)

**Interest & Behavior Targeting** (Facebook):
- Interests: People interested in "business software", "entrepreneurship"
- Behaviors: Recent business travelers, small business owners

**LinkedIn Targeting** (B2B Gold Standard):
- **Job Title**: "Operations Manager", "COO", "Director of Operations"
- **Seniority**: Manager, Director, VP, C-Level
- **Company Size**: 10-50 employees, 51-200 employees
- **Industry**: Marketing Services, Professional Services
- **Skills**: Project management, process improvement

**Custom Audiences** (Retargeting):
- **Website visitors**: People who visited your site (via pixel)
- **Email list**: Upload customer emails, target them
- **Engagement**: People who engaged with your content

**Lookalike Audiences**:
- Facebook/LinkedIn finds people similar to your best customers
- Based on customer list or website visitors

**Best Practice**: Start narrow (specific job titles + company size + industry), then expand if volume is too low.

### Ad Creative Best Practices

**Image Ads**:
- **Image specs**: 1200x628px (1.91:1 ratio) for feed
- **Text on image**: Keep minimal (Facebook used to penalize >20% text)
- **Visual**: Eye-catching, relevant to offer
- **Testing**: Test 3-5 different images

**Video Ads**:
- **Length**: 15-30 seconds ideal (people scroll fast)
- **Hook**: First 3 seconds must grab attention
- **Sound-off friendly**: Add captions (most watch without sound)
- **CTA**: Clear call to action at end

**Copy Structure**:
- **Hook** (first line): Grab attention with problem or outcome
  - Example: "Spending 15+ hours/week on manual client onboarding?"
- **Body**: Expand on problem, introduce solution
- **CTA**: Clear next step
  - Example: "Book a free workflow audit →"

**Headlines**:
- **Direct**: "Automate Your Agency Workflows"
- **Question**: "Tired of Manual Processes?"
- **Outcome**: "Save 10 Hours Per Week"

**LinkedIn Specific**:
- Professional tone (no memes)
- Focus on business outcomes
- Case study/social proof works well
- Long-form copy often outperforms short

### Ad Formats

**Single Image**: Most common, versatile

**Carousel**: Multiple images/videos in one ad, good for showcasing features or case studies

**Video**: Higher engagement, good for explaining complex products

**Lead Generation Forms** (LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms, Facebook Lead Ads):
- Form opens in-platform (pre-filled with user data)
- Higher conversion than sending to landing page
- **Pros**: More leads
- **Cons**: Lower quality leads (too easy to submit)

## Landing Pages and Conversion Optimization

Your ad's job is to get the click. Your landing page's job is to get the conversion.

### Landing Page Principles

**1. Match Message to Ad**:
- If ad says "Client Onboarding Automation", landing page headline should match
- Don't send all traffic to homepage (generic, low conversion)

**2. Single Call to Action**:
- One clear CTA: "Book Demo", "Start Free Trial", "Download Guide"
- Multiple CTAs create confusion and reduce conversion

**3. Remove Distractions**:
- No navigation menu (don't give them ways to leave)
- No outbound links
- Focus: Ad → Landing Page → Conversion

**4. Social Proof**:
- Testimonials, logos of customers, case study results
- Builds trust and credibility

**5. Clear Value Proposition**:
- What will they get?
- Why should they care?
- Why choose you?

**6. Fast Loading**:
- Every second of delay costs ~7% conversion rate
- Optimize images, minimize code

**7. Mobile-Optimized**:
- 50%+ of traffic is mobile
- Test on real devices

### Landing Page Structure

**Above the Fold**:
- Headline: State outcome or benefit
- Subheadline: Expand on value
- CTA button: Clear, contrasting color
- Hero image/video: Relevant visual

**Social Proof Section**:
- Customer logos or testimonial quotes

**Benefits Section**:
- 3-5 key benefits with icons
- Outcome-focused, not feature-focused

**How It Works** (optional):
- 3-step process
- Reduces perceived complexity

**Final CTA**:
- Repeat call to action
- Remove objections ("No credit card required", "Free consultation")

**Example Landing Page Flow**:
1. Headline: "Save 15 Hours Per Week With Automated Workflows"
2. Subheadline: "We build custom no-code automation for agencies—no coding required"
3. CTA: "Book Free Workflow Audit"
4. Logos: "Trusted by 500+ agencies"
5. Benefits: Speed, Reliability, Support
6. How It Works: 1) Audit, 2) Build, 3) Launch
7. Testimonial: Quote from happy customer
8. Final CTA: "Ready to Automate? Book Your Audit"

## Measurement and Optimization

### Key Metrics

**Top-of-Funnel Metrics** (Ad Performance):

**1. Impressions**:
- How many times ad was shown
- **Goal**: Ensure ad is getting seen

**2. Click-Through Rate (CTR)**:
- Formula: (Clicks / Impressions) × 100%
- **Benchmark**:
  - Google Search: 3-5% (good)
  - LinkedIn: 0.3-0.6%
  - Facebook: 0.9-1.5%
- **Meaning**: Higher CTR = more relevant ad

**3. Cost Per Click (CPC)**:
- Formula: Total Spend / Clicks
- **Benchmark**:
  - Google Search: $2-$10 (B2B) $1-$3 (B2C)
  - LinkedIn: $8-$12
  - Facebook: $1-$3
- **Meaning**: Lower CPC = more efficient targeting/creative

**Conversion Metrics** (Landing Page Performance):

**4. Conversion Rate**:
- Formula: (Conversions / Clicks) × 100%
- **Benchmark**: 2-5% for most B2B landing pages
- **Meaning**: Higher rate = better page or more qualified traffic

**5. Cost Per Lead/Acquisition (CPL/CPA)**:
- Formula: Total Spend / Conversions
- **Goal**: CPL < LTV/3 minimum
- **Meaning**: Core metric—are you profitable?

**6. Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)**:
- Formula: Revenue from Ads / Ad Spend
- **Benchmark**: Minimum 3:1, ideally 5:1+
- **Meaning**: For every $1 spent, how much revenue?

### The Optimization Process

**Step 1: Gather Data (Week 1-2)**:
- Let campaigns run, collect at least 100 clicks per ad
- Don't make changes too early (not statistically significant)

**Step 2: Analyze Performance**:
- Which ads have highest CTR? (These resonate)
- Which keywords/audiences have lowest CPC? (Most efficient)
- Which landing pages have highest conversion rate?

**Step 3: Pause Underperformers**:
- Ads with CTR < 50% of average: Pause
- Keywords/audiences with CPA > 2x target: Pause
- **Rule**: Be aggressive cutting losers

**Step 4: Scale Winners**:
- Increase budget on best-performing campaigns
- Create variations of best ads (test new headlines)
- Expand to similar audiences/keywords

**Step 5: Test New Hypotheses**:
- Always be testing new ad copy, audiences, landing pages
- A/B test one variable at a time (don't change everything)
- **Testing Priority**: Targeting > Offer > Creative > Page Design

**Cycle Time**: Review and optimize weekly.

### A/B Testing Framework

**What to Test (in order of impact)**:

**1. Offer/Value Proposition**:
- Test: "Save 10 hours/week" vs "Double your output"
- **Highest impact**

**2. Audience/Targeting**:
- Test: Operations Managers vs Project Managers
- Test: Company size 10-50 vs 50-200

**3. Ad Creative**:
- Test: Different images, headlines, body copy

**4. Landing Page Headline**:
- Test: Outcome-focused vs Problem-focused

**5. CTA**:
- Test: "Book Demo" vs "Start Free Trial"

**Testing Rules**:
- One variable at a time
- Minimum 100 conversions per variant (statistical significance)
- Run tests for at least 1 week (account for day-of-week variance)

## Common Paid Ads Mistakes

### 1. No Clear Goal/Strategy
- **Mistake**: "Let's try ads" with no target CAC or conversion goal
- **Fix**: Define acceptable CAC before spending ($X CAC for $Y LTV)

### 2. Broad, Untargeted Audiences
- **Mistake**: Targeting "all businesses" or "everyone interested in productivity"
- **Fix**: Narrow targeting (job titles + company size + industry)

### 3. Sending Traffic to Homepage
- **Mistake**: Generic destination, no clear CTA
- **Fix**: Dedicated landing page matching ad message

### 4. Not Using Negative Keywords (Google)
- **Mistake**: Showing for "free automation tools" when you charge $10k
- **Fix**: Add comprehensive negative keyword list

### 5. Giving Up Too Early
- **Mistake**: Spending $500, getting no conversions, quitting
- **Fix**: Budget $2-5k minimum for learning phase (plan to not be profitable initially)

### 6. No Landing Page Optimization
- **Mistake**: 0.5% conversion rate, but only focusing on ads
- **Fix**: 50% of the battle is landing page; test and optimize

### 7. Not Tracking Conversions Properly
- **Mistake**: Don't know which keywords/ads drive conversions
- **Fix**: Set up conversion tracking (Google Tag Manager, Facebook Pixel)

### 8. Set and Forget
- **Mistake**: Launch campaigns, never check back
- **Fix**: Weekly optimization reviews minimum
