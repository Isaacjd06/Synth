## OVERALL ASSESSMENT

The knowledge base is in **good condition** with 23 out of 31 files (74.2%) passing all quality standards. All files meet the minimum word count requirement of 3,000+ words, are well-structured, and contain high-quality, detailed content relevant to Synth's purpose.

**Issues Identified**:
- 8 files fail due to formatting inconsistencies in Internal Check sections and/or footer format
- All failures are **formatting issues**, not content quality issues
- Content quality across all files is excellent

**Priority Fixes**:
1. **Internal Check Sections**: 8 files need to add the "Areas where evidence is weaker or context-dependent" subsection
2. **Footer Format**: 7 files need to update footer to include "Ready to save to /lib/knowledge/<path>.md" format

These are straightforward formatting fixes that do not require content rewrites, only structural adjustments to match the required standards.
