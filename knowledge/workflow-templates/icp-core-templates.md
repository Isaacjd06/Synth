# ICP Core Templates

## ICP-Specific Workflow Templates

This document is intended to contain workflow templates specifically designed for Synth's Ideal Customer Profile (ICP).

## Purpose

ICP core templates are pre-designed workflow patterns that address the most common automation needs of Synth's target users. These templates accelerate workflow creation by providing proven patterns for typical use cases.

## Note on ICP Definition

The provided architecture information does not specify Synth's Ideal Customer Profile or their specific workflow needs. This file serves as a placeholder for ICP-specific templates once the target customer profile is defined.

## What Should Be Documented Here

Once the ICP is defined, this document should include:

### ICP Profile Information

**Target User Characteristics:**
- Industry or sector
- Company size
- Role or job function
- Technical proficiency level
- Common pain points
- Typical automation needs

### Common Use Cases

**Frequent Automation Requests:**
- What workflows do ICP users request most?
- What processes are they trying to automate?
- What apps do they commonly use together?
- What triggers are most relevant to them?

### Core Templates

**Pre-Designed Workflows:**
For each common use case:
- Template name
- Description of what it accomplishes
- Trigger configuration
- Actions sequence
- Apps required
- Intent description
- When to use this template
- Configuration parameters users can customize

### Template Categories

**Organized by Use Case:**
- Sales automation templates
- Marketing automation templates
- Operations automation templates
- Support automation templates
- Data management templates
- Communication templates
- Reporting templates
- Or other categories relevant to ICP

## Template Structure

Each ICP core template should include:

### Template Metadata
- Name
- Category
- Description
- Complexity level (simple/multi-step)
- Apps required

### Template Configuration
- Trigger type and configuration
- Actions array with all steps
- Data mappings between steps
- Required parameters
- Optional parameters

### Template Usage
- When this template applies
- What problem it solves
- Prerequisites (apps that must be connected)
- Customization options

### Template Validation
- All apps must be in supported apps list
- Users must have required apps connected
- Template parameters must be validated
- Workflow must pass standard validation

## How Templates Work in Synth

### Template Selection
1. User describes their automation need
2. Synth identifies matching template
3. Synth suggests template to user
4. User confirms or customizes

### Template Instantiation
1. Synth retrieves template structure
2. Synth validates required apps are connected
3. Synth populates template with user-specific data
4. Synth validates complete workflow
5. Synth creates and stores workflow

### Template Customization
- Users can modify trigger parameters
- Users can adjust action configurations
- Users can add or remove actions (with guidance)
- Synth ensures modifications maintain validity

## Benefits of ICP Templates

**Faster Creation:** Pre-designed patterns speed up workflow creation

**Best Practices:** Templates embody proven automation patterns

**User-Friendly:** Reduce complexity for common use cases

**Validated:** Pre-validated templates reduce errors

**Educational:** Help users understand workflow patterns

## Template Development Process

When creating ICP core templates:

1. **Identify Common Pattern**
   - Analyze frequent user requests
   - Identify repeated automation needs
   - Group similar workflows

2. **Design Template**
   - Create generalized workflow structure
   - Define customizable parameters
   - Document use cases

3. **Validate Template**
   - Ensure apps are in supported list
   - Test with various configurations
   - Verify it solves the intended problem

4. **Document Template**
   - Write clear description
   - Explain when to use it
   - Document customization options
   - Provide usage examples

5. **Store Template**
   - Add to ICP core templates collection
   - Make available for template matching
   - Include in Synth's template knowledge

## Template Maintenance

**Keep Templates Updated:**
- When new apps are supported
- When user needs evolve
- When better patterns are discovered
- When Pipedream capabilities expand

**Monitor Template Usage:**
- Which templates are used most?
- Which templates are never used?
- Do users customize templates or use as-is?
- What problems do templates solve?

## Key Principles for ICP Templates

**Relevant:** Address real ICP needs

**Validated:** Pre-checked for correctness

**Flexible:** Allow customization where appropriate

**Clear:** Easy to understand purpose and usage

**Maintained:** Kept current with system capabilities

## Action Required

**To Complete This Document:**
1. Define Synth's Ideal Customer Profile
2. Identify their most common automation needs
3. Design workflow templates for these needs
4. Document each template with full details
5. Validate templates work with supported apps
6. Make templates available in Synth's knowledge base

This document will remain a placeholder until ICP definition and template design are completed.
